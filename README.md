# Sort_Showcase


			                	---G E N E R A L P U R P O S E---
	The Purpose of this Repository is to help visualize the difference in speed of sorting methods,  
	by way of a basic bar-graph coupled with an explanation of the method used,as well as a Big O 
	annotation to assist vocab/ algebraic understanding when talking about algorithms, and wrapping
	it up in a neat HTML page for ease of use.


	I hope that by the end of this your understanding of algorithms 
	and sorting methods are deepened.
